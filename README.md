## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Angular](hhttps://angular.io/) - JS library
- [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages/#readme)

### What I learned

Animations have always been complicated for me, so this challenge helped me to a better understanding of animations with css


### Continued development

I want to improve my CSS animation skills because I think with these, the websites or apps we built can look more modern.

In the next project, I would like to use angular material for greater speed at the time of styling.
